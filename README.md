openmidaas-android-app
======================

This app is a sample implementation of the openmidaas library. The app has the following functionality: 

- Collect attributes (e.g., email address, first name, last name) and save them internally. 
- Verify attributes. Currently only email address and phone number are verifiable. 
- Release attributes to Relying Parties by scanning a Quck Response (QR) code or entering a URL that's present on the Relying Party's website.
